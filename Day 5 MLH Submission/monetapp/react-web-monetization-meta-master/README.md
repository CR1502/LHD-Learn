# react-webmonetization-meta

> Web monetization for React apps:
> This reusable React component will add a custom Web Monetization payment pointer to the document head.
> React Web Monetization takes a Payment pointer and outputs plain HTML Web monetization meta tag. It's dead simple, and React beginner friendly.
